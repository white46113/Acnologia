gc_probability: '1000'
#coupled with session.gc_probability defines the probability that the gc (garbage collection) process is started on every session initialization. The probability is calculated by using gc_probability/gc_divisor, e.g. 1/100 means there is a 1% chance that the GC process starts on each request. session.gc_divisor defaults to 100.

#specifies whether the module will use cookies to store the session id on the client side. Defaults to 1 (enabled).
